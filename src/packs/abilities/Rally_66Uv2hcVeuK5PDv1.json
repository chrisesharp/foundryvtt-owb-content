    "description": "<p>The Tactician is able to rally his men through words and deeds. Often this is done by a rousing speech before a battle commences or by barking out orders and showing disdain for the enemy in the midst of the fighting.</p>\n<p>Rally takes one (1) round to initiate. It grants the Tactician's allies a -1 [+1] bonus to their Armor Class and +1 To-Hit. At 3rd level, this bonus increases to -2 [+2] Armor Class and +2 To-Hit.</p>\n<p>This ability may be used a number of times per day equal to the Tactician's Experience Level and the effects last for six (6) turns.</p>",

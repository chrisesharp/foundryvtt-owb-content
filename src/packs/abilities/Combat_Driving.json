This is particularly useful against tanks and other vehicles with the Reinforced Hull Modification, which is stronger in the front of a vehicle.</p>\n<p>If two Wheelmen are performing Combat Driving against one another, whichever Wheelman wins Initiative succeeds in maneuvering his vehicle into better position.</p>",

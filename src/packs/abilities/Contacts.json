Once per day, whenever the character is in France, he may receive information or assistance from one of these contacts. The Referee is free to determine the nature of these contacts and the assistance they can provide.</p>\n<p>The Referee should secretly roll 1d20 any time a contact is approached. On a roll of 2-3, the information or assistance is faulty. On a roll of \"1\", it is outright wrong.</p>",

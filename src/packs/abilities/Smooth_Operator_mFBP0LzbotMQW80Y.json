If the roll fails, the target believes the Charmer to be an honest friend and ally.</p>\n<p>The target believes any plausible lie and may even risk his life to protect the Charmer. This effect lasts until the Charmer betrays the NPC or there is overwhelming evidence that the Charmer is an enemy.</p>",

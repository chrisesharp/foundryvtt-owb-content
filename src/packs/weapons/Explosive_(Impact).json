    "description": "<p>Impact Explosives include things like pipe bombs, Molotov cocktails, and any other type of explosive device that explodes on contact.</p>\n<p>Impact Explosives do not require precision to be effective. If the target is stationary and in the open, their Armor Class is considered a 9 [10].</p>\n<p>If the character is aiming for a specific target (such as an open door, approaching soldier, balcony, underside of a vehicle, or trench line) or if the character cannot see the target (such as when hurling a pipe bomb at a machinegun nest after taking cover), the target area should be treated as AC 5 [14].</p>\n<p>The Referee is free to determine if a &ldquo;miss&rdquo; causes any damage or any other adverse effects near the target area.</p>\n<p>Impact Explosives typically deliver 1d6+2 Hit Points of damage in a 15' radius.</p>",
